## üõ†Ô∏è Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Git and GitHub account
- Basic understanding of React/Next.js (for frontend contributions)
- Python 3.8+ (for AI/ML contributions)

**Local Setup:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[username]/evafame-creative-chain.git
cd evafame-creative-chain

# Install dependencies (when package.json exists)
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start development server (when implemented)
npm run dev
```

*Note: As we're in early development, some of these commands may not exist yet. Check the README for current setup instructions.*

### Making Contributions

**1. Find or Create an Issue**
- Check existing [issues](../../issues) for something you'd like to work on
- For new features, create an issue first to discuss with the community
- Use issue templates to provide necessary context

**2. Fork and Branch**
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/evafame-creative-chain.git
cd evafame-creative-chain

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**3. Develop and Test**
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Add tests for new functionality where possible
- Test your changes thoroughly before submitting
- Document any new features or API changes

**4. Submit Pull Request**
- Push your branch to your fork
- Create a Pull Request with clear description
- Reference any related issues
- Be responsive to code review feedback

### Code Style Guidelines

**General Principles:**
- **Artist-First**: Code should serve artists' needs, not developer convenience
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Avoid assumptions about global users
- **Accessibility**: Consider artists with different abilities and technical skills
- **Performance**: Remember that some artists have slower internet connections
- **Privacy**: Protect artist data as if it were your own creative work

**Technical Standards:**
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write self-documenting code where possible

### Testing

**Current Testing Approach:**
- Manual testing with artist community members
- Feedback collection through Discord and interviews
- Performance testing with different internet speeds
- Cultural sensitivity review by regional coordinators

**Future Testing Framework:**
- Unit tests for core AI functionality
- Integration tests for platform APIs
- End-to-end tests for artist workflows
- Cultural adaptation testing with community input

## üí¨ Community Guidelines

### Communication Standards

**Be Respectful:**
- Honor different artistic traditions and cultural backgrounds
- Use inclusive language and avoid assumptions
- Listen to artist needs even if you don't understand the creative process
- Acknowledge that art is personal and cultural, not just commercial

**Be Constructive:**
- Focus on solutions that serve artists better
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Ask questions if you don't understand artist workflows
- Share knowledge and resources generously

**Be Patient:**
- Artists and developers have different vocabularies and priorities
- Cultural adaptation takes time and community input
- Consensus-building is slower but creates better outcomes
- Some contributors are learning new skills while participating

### Conflict Resolution

**Community Issues:**
1. **Direct Communication**: Try to resolve issues privately first
2. **Community Mediation**: Involve community moderators if needed
3. **Governance Process**: Use democratic processes for major disputes
4. **Appeal Rights**: Community can appeal moderator decisions

**Technical Disagreements:**
1. **Issue Discussion**: Use GitHub issues for technical debates
2. **Community Input**: Ask artists how different approaches would affect them
3. **Prototype and Test**: Build small demos to test different approaches
4. **Community Vote**: For major architectural decisions, let community decide
