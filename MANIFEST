# Eva & Evafame Open Source Commitment Manifest

> *"Artists deserve tools they truly own - not just use."*

## üéØ Our Irrevocable Promise

Eva, Evafame, and the Creative Chain ecosystem are built for artists, by artists, and will remain community-owned forever. This manifest ensures that no corporation, individual, or external force can ever extract value from the creative tools that artists depend on.

**By contributing to this project, you agree to uphold these principles and help us build a truly artist-owned future.**
