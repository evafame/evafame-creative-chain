Eva Compliance Framework
This document outlines how Eva, an audio-first AI assistant for artists, will comply with diverse financial and IP regulations across regions (e.g., Turkey, Germany, BRICS countries). The framework ensures Eva respects local laws while maintaining its Bitcoin-native, censorship-resistant ethos.

üéØ Objectives

Adapt Eva to regional financial regulations (e.g., AML/KYC, crypto taxes).
Ensure IP protection complies with local laws (e.g., GDPR, fair use).
Minimize national resistance by offering modular compliance options.
Support artists in regulated and unregulated regions.

üõ†Ô∏è Modular Compliance Strategy
1. Financial Compliance

Approach: Use region-specific workflows to meet AML/KYC and crypto regulations.
Implementation (No-Code):
Voiceflow/Bubble: Create conditional workflows (e.g., KYC for India, none for rural Turkey).
Zapier: Integrate KYC APIs (e.g., Onfido, Sumsub) for regulated regions.
Airtable: Store compliance data (e.g., KYC records) securely.


Examples:
India: Apply 30% crypto tax and 1% TDS via ClearTax API integration.
Germany: Ensure GDPR-compliant payment processing (minimal data storage).
BRICS Pay: Plan for future integration with digital currencies (e.g., digital ruble) via API bridges.
Additional Tax Examples:
Turkey: Automate MASAK reporting for crypto transactions and calculate capital gains tax (per local rates).
Russia: Support 13% crypto income tax reporting via TaxJar API.
South Africa (BRICS): Align with SARS crypto tax guidelines.





2. IP Protection Compliance

Approach: Align RGB smart contracts with local IP laws (e.g., GDPR, fair use).
Implementation (No-Code):
ChainGPT: Generate smart contracts with region-specific metadata fields.
Airtable/IPFS: Store minimal data for GDPR compliance, use IPFS for decentralization.
Voiceflow: Prompt artists for compliance (e.g., ‚ÄúIs this artwork original?‚Äù).


Examples:
Germany: GDPR-compliant metadata (e.g., artwork hash, timestamp only).
US: Fair use prompts for derivative works.
Turkey: Support traditional craft terminology in IP records.



3. Offline Compliance

Approach: Cache compliance data locally for offline use (via BitChat mock).
Implementation (No-Code):
Bubble: Cache KYC or IP data in local storage.
Zapier: Sync data when internet is available.


Example: Rural artists in Russia cache payment data offline, syncing when connected.

4. Broader Data Privacy Compliance

Approach: Align with region-specific data privacy laws beyond GDPR (e.g., LGPD in Brazil, PDPB in India, CCPA in the US).
Implementation (No-Code):
Voiceflow: Add consent prompts for region-specific privacy laws.
Airtable: Log user consents securely with timestamps.
Zapier: Automate compliance checks with privacy APIs (e.g., OneTrust for CCPA).


Examples:
Brazil: LGPD-compliant consent for data processing.
India: Local data storage for PDPB compliance.
US: Opt-out options for CCPA compliance.



5. Accessibility for Non-Technical Artists

Approach: Ensure compliance workflows are accessible to artists with limited technical skills or internet access.
Implementation (No-Code):
Voiceflow: Use multilingual voice prompts (e.g., Turkish, Russian) for KYC/IP compliance.
Bubble: Create simple UI for compliance steps (e.g., ‚ÄúYes/No‚Äù buttons).
SMS Integration: Use Twilio for offline compliance prompts (e.g., KYC via SMS in rural Turkey).


Examples:
Rural Turkey: SMS-based KYC verification for artists without internet.
India: Hindi voice prompts for IP compliance.



6. Risk Mitigation for Censorship Resistance

Approach: Balance Eva‚Äôs censorship-resistant ethos with legal compliance in restrictive regions.
Implementation (No-Code):
Bubble: Offer fiat payment options (e.g., Stripe) in crypto-restricted regions.
IPFS: Use only in regions where decentralized storage is legal.
Voiceflow: Warn artists of regional crypto risks (e.g., ‚ÄúCrypto payments may be restricted in your region‚Äù).


Examples:
China (BRICS): Default to fiat payments via WeChat Pay.
Turkey: Monitor MASAK crypto restrictions and offer Papara as a fallback.



7. Monitoring and Auditing

Approach: Track compliance events and audit workflows to ensure accuracy and trust.
Implementation (No-Code):
Airtable: Log compliance events (e.g., KYC completions, tax filings) with timestamps.
Zapier: Schedule periodic API checks (e.g., Onfido, ClearTax) for errors.
Voiceflow: Notify admins of compliance failures (e.g., ‚ÄúKYC rejected in India‚Äù).


Examples:
Germany: Audit GDPR data storage quarterly.
India: Verify ClearTax API filings monthly.



üìã Regional Plans

Evafame T√ºrkiye:
Integrate with local payment systems (e.g., Papara).
Support rural artists with offline BitChat transactions.
Comply with Turkish crypto regulations (e.g., MASAK reporting).


Evafame Deutschland:
GDPR-compliant data storage (minimal artist data).
Connect to German art institutions for IP verification.


BRICS Countries:
Monitor BRICS Pay for blockchain integration (e.g., Ethereum-compatible).
Support digital currencies (e.g., digital rupee) via API bridges.



üöÄ Implementation Steps

Gather Insights:
Use Discord bots to collect artist feedback on compliance workflows.
Create a public GitHub issue tracker for regulatory suggestions from the community.


Build Modules: Create compliance workflows in Voiceflow/Bubble (e.g., KYC for India, GDPR for Germany).
Integrate APIs: Use Zapier to connect KYC (Onfido) and tax APIs (ClearTax).
Test Compliance: Verify workflows with artists in Turkey and Germany.
Document: Update GitHub with compliance examples and community feedback.
