Eva & Evafame | Creative Chain Ecosystem
An open-source, audio-first AI empowering independent artists with Bitcoin’s Layer 2


🌟 Vision
Eva is an AI marketing agent designed to help artists, especially in rural areas with limited literacy or internet, sell their work and protect their intellectual property (IP) using voice commands. Built on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network for fast payments and RGB smart contracts for IP protection, Eva powers the Evafame | Creative Chain—a decentralized network of community-owned platforms for creators worldwide.
Our mission: Connect local talent to the global Bitcoin economy, ensuring fair pay, cultural preservation, and compliance with local laws (e.g., GDPR).

🌱 Status: Seed Phase
We’re in the early stages, building a no-code prototype with tools like Voiceflow, Zapier, and ChainGPT. Join us to:

Conduct artist interviews (20+ done, aiming for 50+).
Develop an audio-first MVP for Turkish artists.
Test offline payments with BitChat.
Grow our open-source community.

Open Source | Bitcoin-Native | Community-Driven

🎨 Why Eva?
Inspired by a Turkish grandmother selling crafts for pennies, Eva solves a key problem: talent is everywhere, but digital tools aren’t. Many artists lack access to platforms that support:

Voice commands for non-literate users.
Bitcoin payments to avoid high fees (20–50% on traditional platforms).
Cultural adaptation for local markets.

Eva is an audio-first AI that speaks your language, protects your art, and connects you to global buyers.

🛠️ MVP Features
Our no-code prototype will include:

Voice Commands: Say “Sell my artwork for $5” in Turkish or English, and Eva creates a Lightning payment link.
IP Protection: Store artwork metadata (e.g., title, hash) in mock RGB smart contracts using ChainGPT and Airtable.
Offline Mode: Cache commands locally via BitChat’s Bluetooth mesh for rural artists with no internet.
Compliance: Modular rules for local laws (e.g., KYC in India, GDPR in Germany) using Onfido.
Cultural Fit: Start with Evafame Türkiye, then expand to Germany, USA, and beyond.


🌍 Global but Local
Eva enables community-owned platforms tailored to each region:

Evafame Türkiye: Turkish voice commands, local payments, rural focus.
Evafame Deutschland: GDPR-compliant, links to German art networks.
Evafame USA: Fair use-compliant, connects to US galleries.
More Regions: Community-led growth (e.g., BRICS countries).


🗣️ How Eva Works

Artist Speaks: “Sell my painting for 5 USD.”
Eva Listens: Voiceflow processes audio, AssemblyAI transcribes Turkish/English.
Eva Acts: Creates a Lightning invoice (via Wallet of Satoshi) and stores IP metadata (via ChainGPT/Airtable).
Offline Support: BitChat caches commands for later syncing.
Community Input: Artists shape features via Discord and GitHub.
