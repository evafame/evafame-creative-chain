Contributing to Eva & Evafame | Creative Chain Ecosystem
Thank you for your interest in Eva, an audio-first AI assistant for independent artists built on Bitcoin’s Layer 2. We’re in the Seed Phase, building a no-code prototype and welcoming contributions from artists, non-coders, developers, and community leaders. No coding experience is required—everyone can help shape Eva!

🎯 Our Vision
Eva empowers artists, especially in rural areas, to sell work and protect IP using Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, RGB smart contracts, and BitChat for offline access. We’re building a community-owned, culturally adapted ecosystem with no-code tools like Voiceflow and ChainGPT.
🤝 How to Contribute
🎨 For Artists
Your creative perspective is vital to shaping Eva. Here’s how you can help:

Share Your Story: Join our artist interviews via Google Forms (linked in our X updates at @evafame) or send us a direct message on X. Share your creative process, challenges with selling art (e.g., high platform fees), or frustrations with complex tools. For example, tell us how you price your paintings or manage sales at local markets.
Test Prototypes: Try our no-code MVP, which supports audio-first payments (e.g., saying “Pay 500 sats for my artwork”) and IP protection. Test it on your phone and record a short voice note about what’s intuitive or confusing, especially if you’re in a rural area or prefer non-text interfaces. Share feedback via X or Google Forms.
Cultural Input: Help Eva reflect your local art scene. Share terms like “nakış” (embroidery in Turkey) or traditions like community art fairs in Germany. Submit ideas via Google Forms or X to ensure Eva’s voice commands and features respect your culture and language.

👩‍💻 For Non-Coders

Build Features: Use no-code platforms (Voiceflow, Bubble, Zapier) to create audio workflows, payment integrations, or compliance modules.
Test UX: Test the prototype’s audio interface on your phone or computer and report issues via GitHub or direct message on X.
Gather Requirements: Collect regulatory or cultural insights from your region (e.g., GDPR in Europe) using Google Forms or Airtable.
Spread the Word: Share Eva on X or with artist communities to grow our reach.

👨‍💻 For Developers

Integrate Blockchain: Contribute to Lightning Network payments, RGB smart contracts, or BitChat’s offline transaction relay.
Enhance AI: Improve audio processing (speech-to-text, NLP) using open-source libraries (e.g., DeepSpeech, Hugging Face).
Guide No-Code: Advise on Voiceflow or Bubble workflows for non-coders.
Maintain Docs: Update technical documentation or prototype examples.

🌍 For Community Leaders

Lead Regional Efforts: Coordinate adaptations for your country (e.g., Evafame Türkiye, Deutschland).
Build Partnerships: Connect with local art institutions or NGOs to support compliance and onboarding.
Engage Communities: Recruit artists and testers via local networks or social media.
